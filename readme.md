# Swift for Sublime

This is a WIP version of a modern Swift (5.6) syntax for Sublime Text 4.

It uses the latest features of the Sublime Text syntax engine, and attempts to be a mostly 1:1 port of https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/zzSummaryOfTheGrammar.html.

Unless you know what you are doing, and want to contribute, you shouldn't use this yet.
